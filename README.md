# tic-tac-toe

This is an gentel attempt to learn programming the fun way. 

Here i will make an attempt to write a simple tic-tac-toe game with minimum functionality first. 

Right now m planning to code it in `Scala` which i've been working on since 2 months now. This will be a fun excercise as i will be using all that i've learnt and get an opportunity to learn many new things. I am also planning to code it in other languages as well, like

* Scala
* C
* Python

As of now these are the only languages i can think of.

I would be glad if anyone is interested in joining this journey of learning the fun way. It maybe anything, not necessarily this game but anything that involves learning along with having some fun.
